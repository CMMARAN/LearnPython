# LearnPython
This Repository is meant for helping people who try to learn python.

This is a IPython Notebook with code snippets to explain the common mistakes which python encounters during programming.
I've tried to explain the mistakes as simple as possible what i have understand. I feel like knowledge of different type of programming errors takes a programmer to next level. 
This list is not complete and always subjected to updation. It will be updated. It would be great more people contribute towards it.
Definitely, bringing up discussion about mistakes will make things easy to understand.
